1.  stdint.h is a library include in c99 that contain new type of integer
2.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int16_t, uint32_t stand for unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int and unsigned long long
3.  BYTE=8bits, DWORD=32bits, LONG=32bit, WORD=16bits
4.  the first charactere un BMP is B and M in ASCII
5.  bfsize store the size of BITMAPFILEHEADER+ header and bsize store the size of Header
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner
7.  The files in BITMAPINFOHEADER which specify BMP color depth is biBitCount
8.  fopen might return NULL in lines 24 and 32 in copy.c because in can't create the output file
9.  because we reading only one the stucture
10. because the scanline should be a multiple of 4 so 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel * 3 padding=12
11. it sets the position indicator associated with the stream to a new position
12. Specifies that offset is a count of characters from the current file position
